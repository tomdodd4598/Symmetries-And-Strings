Symmetries and Strings
======================


Summary
-------

A short piece on the history of relativistic quantum mechanics and string theory. In a few places, I omitted some details where I felt it was appropriate.

The target audience is those who aren't afraid to look up the ideas I've written in bold if they're new to you!

It is entirely possible that I have made some mistakes or written some inaccurate physics - let me know if you see any potential improvements!


Permissions
-----------

In practice, the license on any code I write means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/Symmetries-And-Strings/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
